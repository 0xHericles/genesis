# Overview

Genesis is a personal AI agent framework for Cursor that accumulates your patterns, preferences, and learnings over time.

## What is Genesis?

Genesis provides specialized **agents** that auto-delegate complex tasks, a **protocol** for efficient communication, and a **self-learning** system that extracts patterns from your work.

The more you use it, the smarter it gets about *your* codebase and preferences.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Agents** | Specialized AI subagents that handle planning, reviewing, fixing, and verifying |
| **Principles** | 10 rules that guide all work (.1 through .10) |
| **Playbooks** | Your learned patterns, accumulated over time |
| **Protocol** | Shorthand for efficient communication |

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL genesis.hericl.es | bash
```

This installs agents, rules, and skills to your `~/.cursor/` directory, and creates `~/.genesis/` for your data.

## Philosophy

> Precision over speed. Verification before polish. Learning over repetition.

Genesis is built on the belief that AI agents work best with:

- **Principles** — Clear rules that guide decisions
- **Playbooks** — Standard patterns for common tasks
- **Self-learning** — Continuous improvement from your work
- **Simplicity** — Clean, focused tools that do one thing well
